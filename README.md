# VehicleDatabaseGUI
## Description
Java based application allows user to input data into an embedded Derby database. Application stores and pulls information about
Vehicles from and to the database
## GUI Design Principles
Layout is intended to be simple to use. The table which stores the data is at the center, allowing the user to interprete the information. Two buttons are displayed  underneath the table, allowing the user to interact with the table by adding or deleting items on the table. A second scene is opened allowing the user to input data.
